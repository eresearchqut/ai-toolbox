# Chat

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-n from OpenAI, or Llama from Meta have been trained to generate text. We can use versions of these models tht have been fine-tuned to act as chatbots, allowing you to interact with said models in a conversational style.

[text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) is a popular web interface to interact with Large Language Models.
